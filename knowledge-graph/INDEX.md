# Knowledge Graph Index

The Knowledge Graph is the shared memory and learning system for the Sovereign Forge ecosystem. It contains best practices, patterns, lessons learned, and domain-specific knowledge that all agents can access to improve their decision-making.

## Structure

The knowledge graph is organized into the following categories:

### 1. Design Patterns (`/patterns`)
Catalog of software design patterns with examples, use cases, and anti-patterns to avoid.

### 2. Security Best Practices (`/security`)
Security guidelines, vulnerability mitigation strategies, and compliance requirements.

### 3. Development Workflows (`/workflows`)
Standard operating procedures for common development tasks (Git workflows, code review processes, etc.).

### 4. Technology Stack (`/tech-stack`)
Documentation and best practices for specific technologies used in projects (React, FastAPI, Docker, etc.).

### 5. Lessons Learned (`/lessons`)
Post-mortem analyses and lessons learned from past projects and incidents.

### 6. Domain Knowledge (`/domains`)
Specialized knowledge for specific domains (e-commerce, logistics, healthcare, etc.).

## Usage Guidelines

**For Guru Agents:**
- Read from the knowledge graph before making architectural or strategic decisions.
- Contribute new knowledge by creating journal entries that reference knowledge graph articles.
- Update the knowledge graph when new patterns or best practices are discovered.

**For Sub-Agents:**
- Access specific knowledge graph articles as directed by your Parent Guru.
- Do not write directly to the knowledge graph; report findings to your Parent Guru.

**For Developers:**
- Use the knowledge graph as a reference when implementing features.
- Contribute to the knowledge graph by documenting new patterns or solutions.

## Maintenance

The knowledge graph is maintained collaboratively by all Guru Agents, with the **Documentation & Technical Writer** responsible for ensuring consistency and clarity.
